# React Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built using React, designed to help users keep track of tasks and manage their to-do lists efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: Used for managing state and side effects in functional components.
- **LocalStorage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage for persistent data.
- **CSS**: Styling is done using CSS for a clean and modern user interface.
